Analysis
The data sample comprises of 249 mice, with 51% male and 49% female, indicating a relatively balanced gender distribution.
The dataset includes various factors that can affect treatment results such as treatment regimens,mouse weight,sex,age, and tumor volume.
Capomulin and Ramicane stand out as the most effective drug regimens, as they result in the lowest mean tumor volumes.
Conversely, Ketapril exhibits the highest variance among the regimens, suggesting inconsistent treatment outcomes.
Capomulin and Ramicane are not only effective but also the most commonly administered treatments among the top four promising regimens, which include Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
There is a strong positive correlation (0.84) between mouse weight and average tumor volume within the Capomulin regimen. This indicates that as mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume tends to increase as well, suggesting a potential relationship between these two variables.
Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of different treatment regimens, the distribution of study subjects, and the presence of outliers in the data.
